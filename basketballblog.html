        <td><h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>This is my first web page using the Atom text editor.  The content of this page is based on the first idea that raced through my mind when learning the editor, which naturally was about coaching basketball.</p>
          <p>The goal of this page is to experiment with HTML first, CSS second, and possiblity java script third provided I have enough success with the first two.</p>
          <p>Coaching is an important topic for me.  I have become a head coach in a competitive CYO basketball league because of my youngest son, Nick.  Nick inherits all the benefits of learning through his two older brothers who have also seen me assist other coaches in prior years.  Nick also gets me as a 3rd iteration father, a role which presents me as a "less protective" and "more flexible" parent in comparison to how I taught the sport to my other two sons.  Nick leverages his sibling rivalry to fuel his basketball skill development which I believe has led him to develop basketball skills faster than my other two.  This also is the case in other sports and activities as well.</p>
          <p>Seeing this with Nick, along with my desire to take on a new challenge outside of my IT profession, has led me to take on the volunteer role this season.  I'm learning as I go.  But no matter what happens this season, I know it will be time well spent.</p>
          <h3>Coaching Basketball</h3>
          <p>In prior seasons I assisted other head coaches with practices and games, mostly keeping kids in line and keeping their focus on a drill.  However I never took on, or felt the pressure of, any of the responsibilities that came along with the role.  I was sheilded from a lot.  This was an awakening for me at the start of this season.  I never truly appreciated all the work that was involved.  The planning that goes into teaching a concept.  Running a successful practice.  Evaluating player skillsets.  Creating a rotation for your roster.  It's not all pie in the sky and it's a highly visible responsibility.  You are actually an inspiration for these children.</p>
          <p>Head coach responsibilities include developing drills, developing player skills, and managing playing time with substitutions during a game.  Other responsibilities that a head coach takes on are listed below.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Teach basic skills (dribbling, passing, shooting)</li>
            <li>Organize team practices</li>
            <li>Evaluate individual player skills to create a skill baseline</li>
            <li>Evaluate team knowledge and develop team drills</li>
            <li>Set parent expectations</li>
            <li>Create a rotation with your roster</li>
            <li>Give assignments to your assistant coach(es)</li>
            <li>Set player expecations</li>
            <li>Set parent expectations (did I mention that?)</li>
          </ul>

    <p>It is noteworthy to mention that coaching youth basketball involves an extraordinaty amount of patience.  More often than not, as I've experienced this year, the ideas you may have thought you could explain to a group of energetic kids may not always play out the way it was envisioned.  Take for example a practice when I deciced to introduce a "boxing-out" routine.  I had four surrounding the key, while I had another four on the outside perimeter as the offense.  The goal was to have the four guarding the key to keep the outside four around the perimeter out of the key.  When I shot the ball in the air, one of the kids on defense shoved an offensive player and a small fight started.  There I had to referee a shoving match, explain to them that it's not about shoving, and calm down what was turning into a heated arguement.  That 3 minute distraction spoiled the drill for the other six that were willing to listen because they got bored and wanted to do something else.</p>
    <p>Good God.</P>
    <p><p>So as you can see, it's not as easy as managing your player's playing time during a game. Nor is it about being that loud voice on the sideline.  And it sure is not as easy as other experienced head coaches may make the job seem.</p></p>
